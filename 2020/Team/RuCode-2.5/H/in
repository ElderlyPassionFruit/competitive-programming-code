chapter it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wifehowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughtersmy dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at lastmr bennet replied that he had notbut it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about itmr bennet made no answerdo you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatientlyyou want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing itthis was invitation enoughwhy my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next weekwhat is his namebingleyis he married or singleoh single my dear to be surea single man of large fortune four or five thousand a yearwhat a fine thing for our girlshow sohow can it affect themmy dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresomeyou must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of themis that his design in settling heredesignnonsense how can you talk sobut it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comesi see no occasion for thatyou and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the partymy dear you flatter mei certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary nowwhen a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beautyin such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think ofbut my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhoodit is more than i engage for i assure youbut consider your daughtersonly think what an establishment it would be for one of themsir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomersindeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do notyou are overscrupulous surelyi dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzyi desire you will do no such thinglizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydiabut you are always giving her the preferencethey have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sistersmr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a wayyou take delight in vexing meyou have no compassion for my poor nervesyou mistake me my deari have a high respect for your nervesthey are my old friendsi have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at leastah you do not know what i sufferbut i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhoodit will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit themdepend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them allmr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his characterher mind was less difficult to developshe was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temperwhen she was discontented she fancied herself nervousthe business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and newschapter mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingleyhe had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of itit was then disclosed in the following mannerobserving his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her withi hope mr bingley will like it lizzywe are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visitbut you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce himi do not believe mrs long will do any such thingshe has two nieces of her ownshe is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of herno more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving youmrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughtersdont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sakehave a little compassion on my nervesyou tear them to pieceskitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them illi do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfullywhen is your next ball to be lizzytomorrow fortnightaye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herselfthen my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to herimpossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasingi honour your circumspectiona fortnights acquaintance is certainly very littleone cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnightbut if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her daughters must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myselfthe girls stared at their fathermrs bennet said onlynonsense nonsensewhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried hedo you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsensei cannot quite agree with you therewhat say you maryfor you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extractsmary wished to say something sensible but knew not howwhile mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingleyi am sick of mr bingley cried his wifei am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that beforeif i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on himit is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance nowthe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the whilehow good it was in you my dear mr bennetbut i knew i should persuade you at lasti was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintancewell how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till nownow kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wifewhat an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shuti do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matterat our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anythinglydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next balloh said lydia stoutlyi am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallestthe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinnerchapter not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingleythey attacked him in various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucasher report was highly favourablesir william had been delighted with himhe was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large partynothing could be more delightfulto be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertainedif i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish forin a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his libraryhe had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the fatherthe ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horsean invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it allmr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etcmrs bennet was quite disconcertedshe could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to belady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assemblythe girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousinand when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogethermr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young manmr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected mannershis sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashionhis brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a yearthe gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friendmr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfieldsuch amiable qualities must speak for themselveswhat a contrast between him and his friendmr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own partyhis character was decidedhe was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there againamongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughterselizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join itcome darcy said hei must have you dancei hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manneryou had much better dancei certainly shall notyou know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partnerat such an assembly as this it would be insupportableyour sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up withi would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for a kingdomupon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly prettyyou are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennetoh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheldbut there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeabledo let me ask my partner to introduce youwhich do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly saidshe is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other menyou had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with memr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward himshe told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculousthe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole familymrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield partymr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sistersjane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter wayelizabeth felt janes pleasuremary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ballthey returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitantsthey found mr bennet still upwith a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectationshe had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different story to hearoh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent balli wish you had been therejane was so admired nothing could be like iteverybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twiceonly think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second timefirst of all he asked miss lucasi was so vexed to see him stand up with herbut however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the danceso he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two nextthen the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulangerif he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so muchfor gods sake say no more of his partnerso that he had sprained his ankle in the first danceoh my dear i am quite delighted with himhe is so excessively handsomeand his sisters are charming womeni never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dressesi dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gownhere she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of fineryshe was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcybut i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasingso high and so conceited that there was no enduring himhe walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very greatnot handsome enough to dance withi wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdownsi quite detest the manchapter when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very much she admired himhe is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso much ease with such perfect good breedinghe is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly canhis character is thereby completei was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second timei did not expect such a complimentdid not you i did for youbut that is one great difference between uscompliments always take you by surprise and me neverwhat could be more natural than his asking you againhe could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the roomno thanks to his gallantry for thatwell he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like himyou have liked many a stupider persondear lizzyoh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybodyall the world are good and agreeable in your eyesi never heard you speak ill of a human being in your lifei would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i thinki know you do and it is that which makes the wonderwith your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of othersaffectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywherebut to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you aloneand so you like this mans sisters too do youtheir manners are not equal to hiscertainly notat firstbut they are very pleasing women when you converse with themmiss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in herelizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve themthey were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and conceitedthey were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of othersthey were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trademr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do itmr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchasehis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited hermr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield househe did look at it and into it for halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediatelybetween him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of characterbingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfiedon the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinionin understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was cleverhe was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not invitingin that respect his friend had greatly the advantagebingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offensethe manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristicbingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautifuldarcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasuremiss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too muchmrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they would not object to know more ofmiss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chosechapter within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimatesir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoraltythe distinction had perhaps been felt too stronglyit had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the worldfor though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybodyby nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteouslady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennetthey had several childrenthe eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friendthat the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicateyou began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucasyou were mr bingleys first choiceyes but he seemed to like his second betteroh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twiceto be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr robinsonperhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to youmr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last questionoh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that pointupon my wordwell that is very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you knowmy overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlottemr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is hepoor elizato be only just tolerablei beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by himmrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lipsare you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake said janei certainly saw mr darcy speaking to herayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke tomiss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintanceswith them he is remarkably agreeablei do not believe a word of it my dearif he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs longbut i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaisei do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with elizaanother time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were youi believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with himhis pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for itone cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himselfif i may so express it he has a right to be proudthat is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified minepride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believeby all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginaryvanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymouslya person may be proud without being vainpride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of usif i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a daythen you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directlythe boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visitchapter the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfieldthe visit was soon returned in due formmiss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldestby jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admirationit was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinentshe mentioned this to her friend miss lucasit may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guardedif a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the darkthere is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itselfwe can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragementin nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feelsbingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him onbut she does help him on as much as her nature will allowif i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it tooremember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you dobut if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it outperhaps he must if he sees enough of herbut though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing togetherjane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attentionwhen she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she choosesyour plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt itbut these are not janes feelings she is not acting by designas yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonablenessshe has known him only a fortnightshe danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined with him in company four timesthis is not quite enough to make her understand his characternot as you represent ithad she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four evenings may do a great dealyes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfoldedwell said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonthhappiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chanceif the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the leastthey always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your lifeyou make me laugh charlotte but it is not soundyou know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourselfoccupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friendmr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticisebut no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyesto this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifyingthough he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulnessof this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance withhe began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with othershis doing so drew her noticeit was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembledwhat does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forsterthat is a question which mr darcy only can answerbut if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is abouthe has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of himon his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and saiddid you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at merytonwith great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady energeticyou are severe on usit will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucasi am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what followsyou are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybodyif my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performerson miss lucass persevering however she addedvery well if it must be so it mustand gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my songher performance was pleasing though by no means capitalafter a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for displaymary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reachedelizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the roommr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus beganwhat a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcythere is nothing like dancing after alli consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societycertainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the worldevery savage can dancesir william only smiledyour friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcyyou saw me dance at meryton i believe siryes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sightdo you often dance at st jamessnever sirdo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the placeit is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid ityou have a house in town i concludemr darcy bowedi had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucashe paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to hermy dear miss eliza why are you not dancingmr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before youand taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir williamindeed sir i have not the least intention of dancingi entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partnermr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasionyou excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhourmr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smilinghe is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a partnerelizabeth looked archly and turned awayher resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingleyi can guess the subject of your reveriei should imagine notyou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinioni was never more annoyedthe insipidity and yet the noisethe nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those peoplewhat would i give to hear your strictures on themyour conjecture is totally wrong i assure youmy mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestowmiss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflectionsmr darcy replied with great intrepiditymiss elizabeth bennetmiss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingleyi am all astonishmenthow long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you joythat is exactly the question which i expected you to aska ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a momenti knew you would be wishing me joynay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is absolutely settledyou will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will always be at pemberley with youhe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed longchapter mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of hisher father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand poundsshe had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of tradethe village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the waythe two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their auntat present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarterstheir visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligenceevery day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connectionstheir lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselvesmr phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown beforethey could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensignafter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observedfrom all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the countryi have suspected it some time but i am now convincedcatherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to londoni am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children sillyif i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own howeverif my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of ityesbut as it happens they are all of them very cleverthis is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agreei had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolishmy dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and motherwhen they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we doi remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentalsmamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes librarymrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answermrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter readwell jane who is it fromwhat is it aboutwhat does he saywell jane make haste and tell us make haste my loveit is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloudmy dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without a quarrelcome as soon as you can on receipt of thismy brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officersyours evercaroline bingleywith the officers cried lydiai wonder my aunt did not tell us of thatdining out said mrs bennet that is very unluckycan i have the carriage said janeno my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all nightthat would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her homeoh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirsi had much rather go in the coachbut my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am surethey are wanted in the farm mr bennet are they notthey are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get thembut if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answeredshe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engagedjane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad dayher hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delightedthe rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come backthis was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her owntill the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivancebreakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabethmy dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterdaymy kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am betterthey insist also on my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with meyours etcwell my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your ordersoh i am not afraid of her dyingpeople do not die of little trifling coldsshe will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very welli would go and see her if i could have the carriageelizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternativeshe declared her resolutionhow can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirtyou will not be fit to be seen when you get therei shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i wantis this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horsesno indeed i do not wish to avoid the walkthe distance is nothing when one has a motive only three milesi shall be back by dinneri admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is requiredwe will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydiaelizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off togetherif we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goesin meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exerciseshe was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprisethat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for itshe was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at allthe former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alonethe latter was thinking only of his breakfasther inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answeredmiss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her roomelizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entranceshe was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated withelizabeth silently attended herwhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for janethe apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughtsthe advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutelyelizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewherewhen the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said somiss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the presentelizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clotheschapter at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinnerto the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very favourable answerjane was by no means betterthe sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former disliketheir brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacencyhis anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the othersshe had very little notice from any but himmiss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to herwhen dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the roomher manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no beautymrs hurst thought the same and addedshe has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morningshe really looked almost wildshe did indeed louisai could hardly keep my countenancevery nonsensical to come at allwhy must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a coldher hair so untidy so blowsyyes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its officeyour picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon mei thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morningher dirty petticoat quite escaped my noticeyou observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibitioncertainly notto walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alonewhat could she mean by itit seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorumit shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingleyi am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyesnot at all he replied they were brightened by the exercisea short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began againi have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settledbut with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of iti think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on merytonyes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapsidethat is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartilyif they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeablebut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcyto this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relationswith a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffeeshe was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herselfon entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a bookmr hurst looked at her with astonishmentdo you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singularmiss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cardsshe is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything elsei deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabethi am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many thingsin nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite wellelizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the table where a few books were lyinghe immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library affordedand i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked intoelizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the roomi am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of bookswhat a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcyit ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generationsand then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying booksi cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as theseneglecti am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble placecharles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberleyi wish it maybut i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of modelthere is not a finer county in england than derbyshirewith all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell iti am talking of possibilities charlesupon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitationelizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the gameis miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i ami think she willshe is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather tallerhow i long to see her againi never met with anybody who delighted me so muchsuch a countenance such mannersand so extremely accomplished for her ageher performance on the pianoforte is exquisiteit is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all areall young ladies accomplishedmy dear charles what do you meanyes all of them i thinkthey all paint tables cover screens and net pursesi scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplishedyour list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truththe word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screenbut i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in generali cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplishednor i i am sure said miss bingleythen observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished womanyes i do comprehend a great deal in itoh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met witha woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but halfdeservedall this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive readingi am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished womeni rather wonder now at your knowing anyare you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all thisi never saw such a womani never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe unitedmrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forwardas all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the roomelizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeedsbut in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean artundoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivationwhatever bears affinity to cunning is despicablemiss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subjectelizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave herbingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physiciansthis she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly betterbingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserablethey solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sisterchapter elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sistersin spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgement of her situationthe note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied withmrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfasthad she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfieldshe would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisableafter sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlourbingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expectedindeed i have sir was her answershe is a great deal too ill to be movedmr jones says we must not think of moving herwe must trespass a little longer on your kindnessremoved cried bingleyit must not be thought ofmy sister i am sure will not hear of her removalyou may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with usmrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgmentsi am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i have ever met withi often tell my other girls they are nothing to heryou have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over the gravel walki do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfieldyou will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short leasewhatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutesat present however i consider myself as quite fixed herethat is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabethyou begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards heroh yesi understand you perfectlyi wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitifulthat is as it happensit does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yourslizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at homei did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of characterit must be an amusing studyyes but intricate characters are the most amusingthey have at least that advantagethe country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a studyin a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying societybut people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for everyes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in towneverybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently awaymrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumphi cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public placesthe country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not mr bingleywhen i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the samethey have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in eitherayethat is because you have the right dispositionbut that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at allindeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her motheryou quite mistook mr darcyhe only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be truecertainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods largeri know we dine with fourandtwenty familiesnothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenancehis sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards mr darcy with a very expressive smileelizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming awayyes she called yesterday with her fatherwhat an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not heso much the man of fashion so genteel and easyhe had always something to say to everybodythat is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matterdid charlotte dine with youno she would go homei fancy she was wanted about the mincepiesfor my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up very differentlybut everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure youit is a pity they are not handsomenot that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friendshe seems a very pleasant young womanoh dear yes but you must own she is very plainlady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beautyi do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody better lookingit is what everybody says i do not trust my own partialitywhen she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came awaybut however he did notperhaps he thought her too younghowever he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they wereand so ended his affection said elizabeth impatientlythere has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same wayi wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away lovei have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcyof a fine stout healthy love it mayeverything nourishes what is strong alreadybut if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely awaydarcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself againshe longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzymr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion requiredshe performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriageupon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forwardthe two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfieldlydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early ageshe had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assuranceshe was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep ithis answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers eari am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ballbut you would not wish to be dancing when she is illlydia declared herself satisfiedoh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton againand when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one alsoi shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does notmrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyeschapter the day passed much as the day before had donemrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroomthe lootable however did not appearmr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sistermr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their gameelizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companionthe perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of eachhow delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letterhe made no answeryou write uncommonly fastyou are mistakeni write rather slowlyhow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a yearletters of business toohow odious i should think themit is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yourspray tell your sister that i long to see heri have already told her so once by your desirei am afraid you do not like your penlet me mend it for youi mend pens remarkably wellthank youbut i always mend my ownhow can you contrive to write so evenhe was silenttell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleyswill you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write againat present i have not room to do them justiceoh it is of no consequencei shall see her in januarybut do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcythey are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determineit is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write illthat will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with easehe studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcymy style of writing is very different from yoursoh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginablehe leaves out half his words and blots the restmy ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondentsyour humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproofnothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humilityit is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boastand which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modestythe indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interestingthe power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performancewhen you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone elsenay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morningand yet upon my honour i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this momentat least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladiesi dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerityyour conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to saybingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a monthyou have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own dispositionyou have shown him off now much more than he did himselfi am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temperbut i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i couldwould mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to itupon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himselfyou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledgedallowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its proprietyto yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with youto yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of eitheryou appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affectiona regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into iti am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingleywe may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereuponbut in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into itwill it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the partiesby all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware ofi assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deferencei declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to domr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laughmiss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsensei see your design bingley said his friendyou dislike an argument and want to silence thisperhaps i doarguments are too much like disputesif you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of mewhat you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his lettermr darcy took her advice and did finish his letterwhen that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some musicmiss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herselfmrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on hershe hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strangeshe could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person presentthe supposition did not pain hershe liked him too little to care for his approbationafter playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to herdo not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reelshe smiled but made no answerhe repeated the question with some surprise at her silenceoh said shei heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in replyyou wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempti have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dareindeed i do not dareelizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by herhe really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some dangermiss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabethshe often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliancei hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officersand if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesseshave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicityoh yesdo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberleyput them next to your greatuncle the judgethey are in the same profession you know only in different linesas for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyesit would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copiedat that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herselfi did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheardyou used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming outthen taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted threemr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately saidthis walk is not wide enough for our partywe had better go into the avenuebut elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answeredno no stay where you areyou are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantagethe picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourthgoodbyeshe then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or twojane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that eveningchapter when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appearedtheir powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spiritbut when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many stepshe addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutationhe was full of joy and attentionthe first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the doorhe then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone elseelizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delightwhen tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vainshe had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejectedshe assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleepdarcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennetmiss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his pageshe could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read onat length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and saidhow pleasant it is to spend an evening in this wayi declare after all there is no enjoyment like readinghow much sooner one tires of anything than of a bookwhen i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent libraryno one made any replyshe then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and saidby the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfieldi would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasureif you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cardsi should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meetingit would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the daymuch more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ballmiss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the roomher figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studiousin the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth saidmiss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitudeelizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediatelymiss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked uphe was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his bookhe was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interferewhat could he meanshe was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand himnot at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about itmiss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motivesi have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speakyou either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fireoh shocking cried miss bingleyi never heard anything so abominablehow shall we punish him for such a speechnothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabethwe can all plague and punish one anothertease himlaugh at himintimate as you are you must know how it is to be donebut upon my honour i do noti do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me thattease calmness of manner and presence of mindno nofeel he may defy us thereand as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subjectmr darcy may hug himselfmr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeththat is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a laughmiss bingley said he has given me more credit than can bethe wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a jokecertainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am not one of themi hope i never ridicule what is wise and goodfollies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i canbut these i suppose are precisely what you are withoutperhaps that is not possible for anyonebut it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridiculesuch as vanity and prideyes vanity is a weakness indeedbut pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulationelizabeth turned away to hide a smileyour examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the resulti am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defecthe owns it himself without disguiseno said darcyi have made no such pretensioni have faults enough but they are not i hope of understandingmy temper i dare not vouch forit is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the worldi cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myselfmy feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move themmy temper would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost foreverthat is a failing indeed cried elizabethimplacable resentment is a shade in a characterbut you have chosen your fault welli really cannot laugh at ityou are safe from methere is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evila natural defect which not even the best education can overcomeand your defect is to hate everybodyand yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand themdo let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no sharelouisa you will not mind my waking mr hursther sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attentionchapter in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the daybut mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure beforeher answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get homemrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very wellagainst staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request madethe communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferredmiss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the otherthe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be rightto mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enoughshe attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himselfhe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing itsteady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at heron sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took placemiss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spiritsthey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mothermrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold againbut their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circlethe evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeththey found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen tocatherine and lydia had information for them of a different sortmuch had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be marriedchapter i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family partywho do you mean my deari know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for heri do not believe she often sees such at homethe person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a strangermrs bennets eyes sparkleda gentleman and a strangerit is mr bingley i am surewell i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingleybutgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got todaylydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill this momentit is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my lifethis roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at onceafter amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explainedabout a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attentionit is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleasesoh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentionedpray do not talk of that odious mani do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about itjane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entailthey had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything aboutit certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbournbut if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himselfno that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocriticali hate such false friendswhy could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did before himwhy indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hearhunsford near westerham kent th octoberdear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variancethere mrs bennetmy mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of englandas a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranchi cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafterif you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the dayi remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friendwilliam collinsat four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letterhe seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us againthere is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage himthough it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his creditelizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were requiredhe must be an oddity i think said shei cannot make him outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose he would help it if he couldcould he be a sensible man sirno my dear i think noti have great hopes of finding him quite the reversethere is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises welli am impatient to see himin point of composition said mary the letter does not seem defectivethe idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressedto catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interestingit was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colouras for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughtersmr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole familymr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himselfhe was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formalhe had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriagethis gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readilyyou are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enoughthings are settled so oddlyyou allude perhaps to the entail of this estateah sir i do indeedit is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confessnot that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this worldthere is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailedi am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitatebut i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire themat present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquaintedhe was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each otherthey were not the only objects of mr collinss admirationthe hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future propertythe dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owingbut he was set right there by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchenhe begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hourchapter during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patronesslady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkablemr bennet could not have chosen bettermr collins was eloquent in her praisethe subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherineshe had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before hershe had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the eveninglady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in hershe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relationsshe had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet upstairsthat is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable womanit is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like herdoes she live near you sirthe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residencei think you said she was a widow sirhas she any familyshe has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive propertyah said mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girlsand what sort of young lady is sheis she handsomeshe is a most charming young lady indeedlady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birthshe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with thembut she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponieshas she been presentedi do not remember her name among the ladies at courther indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornamentsher ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladiesi have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by herthese are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to payyou judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacymay i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous studythey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possiblemr bennets expectations were fully answeredhis cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasureby teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladiesmr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating libraryhe started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novelskitty stared at him and lydia exclaimedother books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermonslydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him withdo you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire himmy aunt told me so herself on saturdayi shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from townlydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and saidi have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefitit amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instructionbut i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammonmr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusementsmrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammonchapter mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintancethe subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperitya fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humilityhaving now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common reportthis was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own parthis plan did not vary on seeing themmiss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choicethe next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours teteatete with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engagedmr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fireelizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of coursemrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graceslydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsfordsuch doings discomposed mr bennet exceedinglyin his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and goin pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered merytonthe attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall thembut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the waythe officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passedall were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spotmr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corpsthis was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charminghis appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing addressthe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the streeton distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilitiesbingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal objecthe was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after hermr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other redmr wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just deigned to returnwhat could be the meaning of itit was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to knowin another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friendmr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitationmrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of himshe received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her noticemrs phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shireshe had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellowssome of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the eveningthis was agreed to and mrs phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwardsthe prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spiritsmr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needlessas they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sistermr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs phillipss manners and politenesshe protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her beforesomething he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his lifechapter as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the housewhen this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers roomin describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she couldto the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very longit was over at last howeverthe gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admirationthe officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips breathing port wine who followed them into the roommr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speakerwith such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffinwhen the cardtables were placed he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whisti know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reasonmr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydiaat first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particularallowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe history of his acquaintance with mr darcyshe dared not even mention that gentlemanher curiosity however was unexpectedly relievedmr wickham began the subject himselfhe inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying thereabout a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop addedhe is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understandyes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annumyou could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancyelizabeth could not but look surprisedyou may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterdayare you much acquainted with mr darcyas much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmlyi have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeablei have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwisei am not qualified to form onei have known him too long and too well to be a fair judgeit is impossible for me to be impartialbut i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere elsehere you are in your own familyupon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfieldhe is not at all liked in hertfordshireeverybody is disgusted with his prideyou will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyonei cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happenthe world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seeni should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered manwickham only shook his headi wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longeri do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfieldi hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhoodoh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcyif he wishes to avoid seeing me he must gowe are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he ishis father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollectionshis behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his fatherelizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquirymr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantryit was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shirei knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured themsociety i own is necessary to mei have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitudei must have employment and societya military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligiblethe church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just nowindeedyesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gifthe was my godfather and excessively attached to mei cannot do justice to his kindnesshe meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewheregood heavens cried elizabeth but how could that behow could his will be disregardedwhy did you not seek legal redressthere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothingcertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose iti have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freelyi can recall nothing worsebut the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates methis is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgracedsome time or other he will bebut it shall not be by metill i can forget his father i can never defy or expose himelizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed thembut what said she after a pause can have been his motivewhat can have induced him to behave so cruellya thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousyhad the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in lifehe had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given mei had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked himi had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as thisafter a few minutes reflection however she continuedi do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temperhis disposition must be dreadfuli will not trust myself on the subject replied wickhami can hardly be just to himelizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimedto treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his fathershe could have addeda young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest mannerwe were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental caremy father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley propertyhe was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friendmr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myselfhow strange cried elizabethhow abominablei wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to youif from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call itit is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friendit has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feelingbut we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pridecan such abominable pride as his have ever done him goodyesit has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poorfamily pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave done thisnot to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motivehe has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brotherswhat sort of girl is miss darcyhe shook his headi wish i could call her amiableit gives me pain to speak ill of a darcybut she is too much like her brothervery very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusementbut she is nothing to me nowshe is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplishedsince her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her educationafter many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and sayingi am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingleyhow can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a manhow can they suit each otherdo you know mr bingleynot at allhe is a sweettempered amiable charming manhe cannot know what mr darcy isprobably not but mr darcy can please where he chooseshe does not want abilitieshe can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his whileamong those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperoushis pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figurethe whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips the usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latterit had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasyi know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any objectthere are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little mattersmr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourghlady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a livingi hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her longyou know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcyno indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines connectionsi never heard of her existence till the day before yesterdayher daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estatesthis information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingleyvain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined for anothermr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited womani believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickhami have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolentshe has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first classelizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentionsthere could be no conversation in the noise of mrs phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to everybodywhatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefullyelizabeth went away with her head full of himshe could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silentlydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn housechapter elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herselfjane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickhamthe possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explainedthey have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no ideainterested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the otherit is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either sidevery true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the businessdo clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebodylaugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinionmy dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide forit is impossibleno man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of itcan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in himoh noi can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremonyif it be not so let mr darcy contradict itbesides there was truth in his looksit is difficult indeedit is distressing one does not know what to thinki beg your pardon one knows exactly what to thinkbut jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became publicthe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesdaythe two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separationto the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the othersthey were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilitiesthe prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the familymrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious cardjane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of her brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look and behaviorthe happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a balland even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for itwhile i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagementssociety has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybodyelizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dancei am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for herelizabeth felt herself completely taken inshe had fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had never been worse timedthere was no help for it howevermr wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she couldshe was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitorsthe idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to herelizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any replymr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about himif there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton onceno aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxyeven elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydiachapter till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to herthe certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the eveningbut in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smilei do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman herethis part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to makeattendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickhamshe was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked herbut elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular noticethe first two dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortificationmr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can givethe moment of her release from him was ecstasyshe danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally likedwhen those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted himhe walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console heri dare say you will find him very agreeableheaven forbidthat would be the greatest misfortune of allto find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hatedo not wish me such an evilwhen the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequenceelizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding itthey stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dancehe replied and was again silentafter a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time withit is your turn to say something now mr darcyi talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of coupleshe smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be saidvery wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public onesbut now we may be silentdo you talk by rule then while you are dancingsometimesone must speak a little you knowit would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possibleare you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mineboth replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverbthis is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to sayyou think it a faithful portrait undoubtedlyi must not decide on my own performancehe made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to merytonshe answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation addedwhen you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintancethe effect was immediatea deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go onat length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner saidmr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certainhe has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his lifedarcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subjectat that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partneri have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sirsuch very superior dancing is not often seenit is evident that you belong to the first circlesallow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take placewhat congratulations will then flow ini appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding methe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing togetherrecovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and saidsir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking ofi do not think we were speaking at allsir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imaginewhat think you of books said he smilingbooksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelingsi am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinionsnoi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something elsethe present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he with a look of doubtyes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaimingi remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasableyou are very cautious i suppose as to its being createdi am said he with a firm voiceand never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudicei hope notit is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at firstmay i ask to what these questions tendmerely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it outand what is your successshe shook her headi do not get on at alli hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedinglyi can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on eitherbut if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunityi would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly repliedshe said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against anotherthey had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain accosted herso miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys stewardlet me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manneri do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the wayhis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do iti pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much betterhis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himselfi beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneerexcuse my interferenceit was kindly meantinsolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as thisi see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcyshe then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingleyjane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happinessi want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickhambut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardonno replied janei have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell youmr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young mani am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regardmr bingley does not know mr wickham himselfno he never saw him till the other morning at merytonthis account then is what he has received from mr darcyi am satisfiedbut what does he say of the livinghe does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally onlyi have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances onlymr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did beforeshe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentimentelizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in iton their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discoveryi have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patronessi happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherinehow wonderfully these sort of things occurwho would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assemblyi am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it beforemy total ignorance of the connection must plead my apologyyou are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcyindeed i ami shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlieri believe him to be lady catherines nephewit will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennightelizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintancemr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thusmy dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintainedyou must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of dutypardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourselfand with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evidenther cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apologyhunsford and lady catherine de bourghit vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civilitymr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabethi have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my receptionmr darcy seemed much pleased with the attentionhe answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthilyit was really a very handsome thoughtupon the whole i am much pleased with himas elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as janeshe saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sistersher mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too muchwhen they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingleyit was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the matchhis being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could doit was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her lifeshe concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of itin vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to themher mother only scolded her for being nonsensicalwhat is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of himi am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hearfor heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be for you to offend mr darcyyou will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doingnothing that she could say however had any influenceher mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexationshe could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by herthe expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravityat length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chickenelizabeth now began to revivebut not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the companyby many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her songelizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began anothermarys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agoniesshe looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingleyshe looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably graveshe looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all nighthe took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloudthat will do extremely well childyou have delighted us long enoughlet the other young ladies have time to exhibitmary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no goodothers of the party were now applied toif i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergymani do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended tothe rector of a parish has much to doin the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patronhe must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possibleand i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his prefermenti cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the familyand with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young manto elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessedthat his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerablethe rest of the evening brought her little amusementshe was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with othersin vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the roomhe assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole eveningthere was no arguing upon such a projectshe owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herselfshe was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speakshe felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in itthe longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the familymrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselvesthey repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guestsdarcy said nothing at allmr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scenemr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each otherelizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation oflord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawnwhen at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitationbingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short timemrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four monthsof having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasureelizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfieldchapter the next day opened a new scene at longbournmr collins made his declaration in formhaving resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the businesson finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these wordsmay i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morningbefore elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet answered instantlyoh dearyescertainlyi am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objectioncome kitty i want you upstairsand gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called outdear madam do not goi beg you will not gomr collins must excuse mehe can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not heari am going away myselfno no nonsense lizzyi desire you to stay where you areand upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collinselizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversionmrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins beganbelieve me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfectionsyou would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this addressyou can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistakenalmost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future lifebut before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly didthe idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continuedmy reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patronesstwice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she saidmr collins you must marrya clergyman like you must marrychoose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good waythis is my advicefind such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit herallow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offeryou will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excitethus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young womenbut the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longeri could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several yearsthis has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteemand now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affectionto fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled toon that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are marriedit was absolutely necessary to interrupt him nowyou are too hasty sir she criedyou forget that i have made no answerlet me do it without further loss of timeaccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying mei am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline themi am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third timei am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere longupon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declarationi do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second timei am perfectly serious in my refusalyou could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situationwere it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of youand you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualificationindeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessaryyou must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i sayi wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwisein making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproachthis matter may be considered therefore as finally settledand rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thus addressed herwhen i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female characterreally mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedinglyif what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being oneyou must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of coursemy reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirablemy situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made youyour portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualificationsas i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant femalesi do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable mani would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincerei thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossiblemy feelings in every respect forbid itcan i speak plainerdo not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heartyou are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptableto such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant femalechapter mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connectionmr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her characterthis information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying sobut depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reasoni will speak to her about it directlyshe is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know itpardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage stateif therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicitysir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmedlizzy is only headstrong in such matters as thesein everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever livedi will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sureshe would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the libraryoh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproaryou must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have hermr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communicationi have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speechof what are you talkingof mr collins and lizzylizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzyand what am i to do on the occasionit seems an hopeless businessspeak to lizzy about it yourselftell her that you insist upon her marrying himlet her be called downshe shall hear my opinionmrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the librarycome here child cried her father as she appearedi have sent for you on an affair of importancei understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriageis it trueelizabeth replied that it wasvery welland this offer of marriage you have refusedi have sirvery wellwe now come to the pointyour mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so mrs bennetyes or i will never see her againan unhappy alternative is before you elizabethfrom this day you must be a stranger to one of your parentsyour mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you doelizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointedwhat do you mean mr bennet in talking this wayyou promised me to insist upon her marrying himmy dear replied her husband i have two small favours to requestfirst that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my roomi shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may benot yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the pointshe talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turnsshe endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacksthough her manner varied however her determination never didmr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passedhe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other wayhis regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regretwhile the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with themshe was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisperi am glad you are come for there is such fun herewhat do you think has happened this morningmr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have himcharlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her familypray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with mei am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nervescharlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabethaye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own waybut i tell you miss lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is deadi shall not be able to keep youand so i warn youi have done with you from this very dayi told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my wordi have no pleasure in talking to undutiful childrennot that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybodypeople who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talkingnobody can tell what i sufferbut it is always sothose who do not complain are never pitiedher daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritationshe talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girlsnow i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversation togetherelizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hearin a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected conversationoh mr collinsmy dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this pointfar be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughterresignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resignedperhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimationyou will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalfmy conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your ownbut we are all liable to errori have certainly meant well through the whole affairmy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologisechapter the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her motheras for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silencehe scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friendthe morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or ill healthmr collins was also in the same state of angry prideelizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stayafter breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ballhe joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked overto elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposedi found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myselfshe highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to herhis accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mothersoon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfieldthe envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passagesjane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairswhen they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter saidthis is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good dealthe whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back againyou shall hear what she saysshe then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a housethe next was in these wordsi do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondencei depend on you for thatto these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it in the enjoyment of hisit is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the countrybut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sistersmr bingley will not be detained in london by themcaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winteri will read it to youwhen my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotelmany of my acquaintances are already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i despairi sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive youit is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winterit is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he shouldwhy will you think soit must be his own doing he is his own masterbut you do not know alli will read you the passage which particularly hurts mei will have no reserves from youmr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her againi really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sisteri do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonablemy brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heartwith all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so manywhat do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enoughdoes it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guardcan there be any other opinion on the subjectyes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear itmost willinglyyou shall have it in a few wordsmiss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcyshe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about youjane shook her headindeed jane you ought to believe meno one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affectionmiss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpletoncould she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothesbut the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the waybut my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friendif we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easybut i know the foundation is unjustcaroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herselfthat is rightyou could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in minebelieve her to be deceived by all meansyou have now done your duty by her and must fret no longerbut my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhereyou must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse himhow can you talk so said jane faintly smilingyou must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitatei did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassionbut if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be requireda thousand things may arise in six monthsthe idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyoneshe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effectjanes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heartthey agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate togetherafter lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courseschapter the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collinselizabeth took an opportunity of thanking herit keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can expresscharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her timethis was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herselfsuch was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soonbut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feethe was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesdayhis reception however was of the most flattering kindmiss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lanebut little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her therein as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happinessthe stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gainedsir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacritymr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fairlady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamessthe whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasionthe younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maidcharlotte herself was tolerably composedshe had gained her point and had time to consider of ither reflections were in general satisfactorymr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginarybut still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from wantthis preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of itthe least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other personelizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobationshe resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the familya promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous loveas he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him to visit themmy dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possiblethey were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately saidbut is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good siryou had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patronessmy dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrenceyou cannot be too much upon your guardrisk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offencebelieve me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshireas for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabethwith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick returnmrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept himshe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companionbut on the following morning every hope of this kind was done awaymiss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day beforethe possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying outengaged to mr collinsmy dear charlotteimpossiblethe steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly repliedwhy should you be surprised my dear elizado you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with youbut elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happinessi see what you are feeling replied charlotteyou must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr collins was wishing to marry youbut when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have donei am not romantic you know i never wasi ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage stateelizabeth quietly answeredundoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the familycharlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heardit was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a matchthe strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now acceptedshe had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantagecharlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating pictureand to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosenchapter elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the familywith many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimedgood lordsir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzynothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesyelizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from londonmrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid ventin the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken offtwo inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the daynothing could console and nothing could appease hernor did that day wear out her resentmenta week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughtermr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughterjane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbablekitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at merytonlady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness awaybetween elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them againher disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his returnjane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear againthe promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have promptedafter discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of menmr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs benneton the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husbandit was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesomeshe hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeablesuch were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absenceneither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subjectday after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehoodeven elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him awayunwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently occurringthe united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachmentas for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded tobut as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill usedit needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillitymr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introductionhe was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his companythe chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bedmrs bennet was really in a most pitiable statethe very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked ofthe sight of miss lucas was odious to heras her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrencewhenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were deadshe complained bitterly of all this to her husbandindeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take her place in itmy dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughtslet us hope for better thingslet us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivorthis was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as beforei cannot bear to think that they should have all this estateif it was not for the entail i should not mind itwhat should not you mindi should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibilityi never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entailhow anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins toowhy should he have it more than anybody elsei leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennetchapter miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubtthe very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the countryhope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfortmiss darcys praise occupied the chief of ither many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former lettershe wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furnitureelizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignationher heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all othersto carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no creditthat he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinationhad his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himselfit was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailingshe could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally woundeda day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help sayingoh that my dear mother had more command over herselfshe can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on himbut i will not repineit cannot last longhe will be forgot and we shall all be as we were beforeelizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothingyou doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reasonhe may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is alli have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him withthank god i have not that paina little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the betterwith a stronger voice she soon addedi have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myselfmy dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too goodyour sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deservemiss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affectionnay said elizabeth this is not fairyou wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against itdo not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwillyou need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think wellthe more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sensei have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriageit is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountablemy dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as thesethey will ruin your happinessyou do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temperconsider mr collinss respectability and charlottes steady prudent characterremember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousinto oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heartmy dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinkingyou shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucasyou shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happinessi must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy togetherbut enough of thisyou alluded to something else you mentioned two instancesi cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunkwe must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injuredwe must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspectit is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives uswomen fancy admiration means more than it doesand men take care that they shouldif it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imaginei am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be miserythoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the businessand do you impute it to either of thoseyes to the lastbut if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteemstop me whilst you canyou persist then in supposing his sisters influence himyes in conjunction with his friendi cannot believe itwhy should they try to influence himthey can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure ityour first position is falsethey may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pridebeyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposingthey have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her betterbut whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brotherswhat sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionableif they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeedby supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappydo not distress me by the ideai am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisterslet me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understoodelizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between themmrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexityher daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every daymrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summermr bennet treated the matter differentlyso lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i findi congratulate hernext to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and thenit is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companionswhen is your turn to comeyou will hardly bear to be long outdone by janenow is your timehere are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the countrylet wickham be your manhe is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditablythank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy mewe must not all expect janes good fortunetrue said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of itmr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn familythey saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreservethe whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the mattermiss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of menchapter after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturdaythe pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of menhe took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thankson the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbournmr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as educationthe netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and agreeablemrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn niecesbetween the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in townthe first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashionswhen this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listenmrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain ofthey had all been very illused since she last saw her sistertwo of her girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in iti do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she couldbut lizzyoh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own perversenesshe made her an offer in this very room and she refused himthe consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as everthe lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can geti am sorry to say it of them but so it isit makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody elsehowever your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleevesmrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversationwhen alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subjectit seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said shei am sorry it went offbut these things happen so oftena young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequentan excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for uswe do not suffer by accidentit does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days beforebut that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little ideait is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachmentpray how violent was mr bingleys lovei never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by herevery time they met it was more decided and remarkableat his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answercould there be finer symptomsis not general incivility the very essence of loveoh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have feltpoor janei am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediatelyit had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it soonerbut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with uschange of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anythingelizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescencei hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence herwe live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all unless he really comes to see herand that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of londonmy dear aunt how could you think of itmr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without himso much the betteri hope they will not meet at allbut does not jane correspond with his sistershe will not be able to help callingshe will drop the acquaintance entirelybut in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopelessit was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractionsmiss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing himthe gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagementmrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinnerwhen the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of itof which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them bothwithout supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachmentto mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powersabout ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belongedthey had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuringmrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly wellhere consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discoursein comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herselfon being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boychapter mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went onyou are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openlyseriously i would have you be on your guarddo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudenti have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do betterbut as it is you must not let your fancy run away with youyou have sense and we all expect you to use ityour father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sureyou must not disappoint your fathermy dear aunt this is being serious indeedyes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewisewell then you need not be under any alarmi will take care of myself and of mr wickham toohe shall not be in love with me if i can prevent itelizabeth you are not serious nowi beg your pardon i will try againat present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am notbut he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should noti see the imprudence of itoh that abominable mr darcymy fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit itmy father however is partial to mr wickhamin short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resistall that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurryi will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first objectwhen i am in company with him i will not be wishingin short i will do my bestperhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very oftenat least you should not remind your mother of inviting himas i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from thatbut do not imagine that he is always here so oftenit is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this weekyou know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friendsbut really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfiedher aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resentedmr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennethis marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happythursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the roomas they went downstairs together charlotte saidi shall depend on hearing from you very often elizathat you certainly shalland i have another favour to ask youwill you come and see mewe shall often meet i hope in hertfordshirei am not likely to leave kent for some timepromise me therefore to come to hunsfordelizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visitmy father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the partyindeed eliza you will be as welcome as either of themthe wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usualelizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossibleelizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what wascharlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseenshe wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praisethe house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obligingit was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the restjane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleysher impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally isjane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from carolineshe accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lostmy aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor streetshe wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingleyi did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to londoni was right therefore my last letter had never reached heri inquired after their brother of coursehe was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw himi found that miss darcy was expected to dinneri wish i could see hermy visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going outi dare say i shall see them soon hereelizabeth shook her head over this letterit convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in townfour weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of himshe endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattentionafter waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longerthe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she feltmy dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for mebut my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicioni do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived againcaroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantimewhen she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longeri pity though i cannot help blaming hershe was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her sidebut i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of iti need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiablei cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long agohe knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcyi cannot understand itif i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all thisbut i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and auntlet me hear from you very soonmiss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certaintywe had better not mention iti am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsfordpray go to see them with sir william and mariai am sure you will be very comfortable thereyours etcthis letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at leastall expectation from the brother was now absolutely overshe would not even wish for a renewal of his attentionshis character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown awaymrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herselfhis apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one elseelizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material painher heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted itthe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independencenothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happyall this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evilbut my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss kingi cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girlthere can be no love in all thismy watchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificanceimportance may sometimes be purchased too dearlykitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i dothey are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plainchapter with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass awaymarch was to take elizabeth to hunsfordshe had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certaintyabsence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collinsthere was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sakethe journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delayeverything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketchshe was to accompany sir william and his second daughterthe improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could bethe only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letterthe farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even morehis present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasingher fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeablesir william lucas and his daughter maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaiseelizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too longhe could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his informationit was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noonas they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as everon the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lowerall was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatreselizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunttheir first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejectionit was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue longmrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintancemrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so wellbut my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss kingi should be sorry to think our friend mercenarypray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motivewhere does discretion end and avarice beginlast christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenaryif you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to thinkshe is a very good kind of girl i believei know no harm of herbut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortunenowhat should heif it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poorbut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this eventa man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observeif she does not object to it why should weher not objecting does not justify himit only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feelingwell cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolishno lizzy that is what i do not choosei should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshireoh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much betteri am sick of them allthank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend himstupid men are the only ones worth knowing after alltake care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointmentbefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summerwe have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakesno scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and gratefuloh my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicityyou give me fresh life and vigouradieu to disappointment and spleenwhat are young men to rocks and mountainsoh what hours of transport we shall spendand when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anythingwe will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seenlakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situationlet our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellerschapter every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delightwhen they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in viewthe palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitantsat length the parsonage was discerniblethe garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arrivingmr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole partyin a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each othermrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately receivedshe saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her familythey were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshmentelizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing himbut though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companionwhen mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotteonce or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hearafter sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himselfto work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possiblehere leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behindhe could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clumpbut of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his houseit was a handsome modern building well situated on rising groundfrom his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands helpit was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the creditwhen mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgottenshe had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the countryit was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observedyes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with hershe is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is overi have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay hereher behaviour to my dear charlotte is charmingwe dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for usi should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has severallady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbourvery true my dear that is exactly what i sayshe is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deferencethe evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very wellshe had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it allabout the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after hershe opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried outoh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seeni will not tell you what it ismake haste and come down this momentelizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gateand is this all cried elizabethi expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughterla my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherinethe old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourghonly look at hershe is quite a little creaturewho would have thought that she could be so thin and smallshe is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this windwhy does she not come inoh charlotte says she hardly ever doesit is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes ini like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideasshe looks sickly and crossyes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wifemr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that wayat length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the housemr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next daychapter mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was completethe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enoughi confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosingsi rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happenbut who could have foreseen such an attention as thiswho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrivali am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquireabout the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommonscarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosingsmr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower themwhen the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabethdo not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparellady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughteri would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything morelady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressedshe likes to have the distinction of rank preservedwhile they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinnersuch formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamessas the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the parkevery park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourghwhen they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calmelizabeths courage did not fail hershe had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidationfrom the entrancehall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sittingher ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessaryin spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to lookelizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedlylady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsomeher air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rankshe was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he representedwhen after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so smallthere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladiesmiss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyesafter sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summerthe dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greaterhe carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bearbut lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to themthe party did not supply much conversationelizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertimemrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposedmaria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admirewhen the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controvertedshe inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultryelizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to othersin the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girlshe asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden nameelizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then observedyour fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i thinkfor your sake turning to charlottei am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female lineit was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs familydo you play and sing miss benneta littleoh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear youour instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some daydo your sisters play and singone of them doeswhy did not you all learnyou ought all to have learnedthe miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yoursdo you drawno not at allwhat none of younot onethat is very strangebut i suppose you had no opportunityyour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of mastersmy mother would have had no objection but my father hates londonhas your governess left youwe never had any governessno governesshow was that possiblefive daughters brought up at home without a governessi never heard of such a thingyour mother must have been quite a slave to your educationelizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the casethen who taught you who attended to youwithout a governess you must have been neglectedcompared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the meanswe were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessarythose who chose to be idle certainly mightaye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage onei always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give itit is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that wayi am always glad to get a young person well placed outfour nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with hermrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank meshe finds miss pope a treasurelady catherine said she you have given me a treasureare any of your younger sisters out miss bennetyes maam allallwhat all five out at oncevery oddand you only the secondthe younger ones out before the elder ones are marriedyour younger sisters must be very youngyes my youngest is not sixteenperhaps she is full young to be much in companybut really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry earlythe lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the firstand to be kept back on such a motivei think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mindupon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a personpray what is your agewith three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own itlady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinenceyou cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your agei am not oneandtwentywhen the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables were placedlady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her partytheir table was superlatively stupidscarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little lighta great deal more passed at the other tablelady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herselfmr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too manysir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble nameswhen lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately orderedthe party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrowfrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departedas soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really wasbut her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own handschapter sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met withwhile sir william was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom which fronted the roadthe room in which the ladies sat was backwardselizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangementfrom the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every dayshe not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get outvery few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hoursnow and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visitsshe examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her familyelizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plentythe entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the firsttheir other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reachthis however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doorsher favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosityin this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed awayeaster was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be importantelizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herselfhis arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligenceon the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respectsthere were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied himcharlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect addingi may thank you eliza for this piece of civilitymr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon meelizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the roomcolonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentlemanmr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend met her with every appearance of composureelizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a wordcolonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybodyat length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her familyshe answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause addedmy eldest sister has been in town these three monthshave you never happened to see her thereshe was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennetthe subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went awaychapter colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosingsit was some days however before they received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the eveningfor the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughtercolonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen only at churchthe invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroomher ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the roomcolonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very muchhe now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcyhis eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call outwhat is that you are saying fitzwilliamwhat is it you are talking ofwhat are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it iswe are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a replyof musicthen pray speak aloudit is of all subjects my delighti must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of musicthere are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural tasteif i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficientand so would anne if her health had allowed her to applyi am confident that she would have performed delightfullyhow does georgiana get on darcymr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiencyi am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deali assure you madam he replied that she does not need such adviceshe practises very constantlyso much the betterit cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any accounti often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practicei have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons roomshe would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the housemr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made no answerwhen coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrumenthe drew a chair near herlady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenanceelizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and saidyou mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear mei will not be alarmed though your sister does play so wellthere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of othersmy courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate mei shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your ownelizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliamyour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i sayi am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of creditindeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to heari am not afraid of you said he smilinglypray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliami should like to know how he behaves among strangersyou shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadfulthe first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he didhe danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partnermr darcy you cannot deny the facti had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own partytrue and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroomwell colonel fitzwilliam what do i play nextmy fingers wait your ordersperhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangersshall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliamshall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangersi can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to himit is because he will not give himself the troublei certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen beforei cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see donemy fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens dothey have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expressionbut then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the trouble of practisingit is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior executiondarcy smiled and saidyou are perfectly rightyou have employed your time much betterno one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wantingwe neither of us perform to strangershere they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking ofelizabeth immediately began playing againlady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcymiss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london mastershe has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annesanne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learnelizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relationlady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and tasteelizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all homechapter elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitoras she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the roomhe seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be withinthey then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silenceit was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observedhow very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcyit must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day beforehe and his sisters were well i hope when you left londonperfectly so i thank youshe found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause addedi think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield againi have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the futurehe has many friends and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasingif he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family therebut perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principlei should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offerselizabeth made no answershe was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to himhe took the hint and soon began withthis seems a very comfortable houselady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsfordi believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful objectmr collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wifeyes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they hadmy friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever didshe seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for herit must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friendsan easy distance do you call itit is nearly fifty milesand what is fifty miles of good roadlittle more than half a days journeyyes i call it a very easy distancei should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabethi should never have said mrs collins was settled near her familyit is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshireanything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear faras he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answeredi do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her familythe far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstanceswhere there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evilbut that is not the case heremr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distancemr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and saidyou cannot have a right to such very strong local attachmentyou cannot have been always at longbournelizabeth looked surprisedthe gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voiceare you pleased with kenta short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk the teteatete surprised themmr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went awaywhat can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gonemy dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called us in this familiar waybut when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of yearall field sports were overwithin doors there was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every daythey called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their auntit was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mindbut why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understandit could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himselfhe seldom appeared really animatedmrs collins knew not what to make of himcolonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it outshe watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much successhe certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputableit was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mindshe had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her powerin her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliamhe was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at allchapter more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcyshe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hershow it could occur a second time therefore was very oddyet it did and even a thirdit seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with herhe never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there toohis words seemed to imply itcould he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughtsshe supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarterit distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonageshe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting herputting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she saidi did not know before that you ever walked this wayi have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonageare you going much fartherno i should have turned in a momentand accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage togetherdo you certainly leave kent on saturday said sheyesif darcy does not put it off againbut i am at his disposalhe arranges the business just as he pleasesand if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least pleasure in the great power of choicei do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcyhe likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliambut so we all doit is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poori speak feelinglya younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependencein my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of eithernow seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependencewhen have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy forthese are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that naturebut in matters of greater weight i may suffer from want of moneyyounger sons cannot marry where they likeunless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often doour habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to moneyis this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively toneand pray what is the usual price of an earls younger sonunless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand poundshe answered her in the same style and the subject droppedto interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards saidi imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposali wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kindbut perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with herno said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with mei am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcyare you indeedand pray what sort of guardians do you makedoes your charge give you much troubleyoung ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own wayas she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truthshe directly repliedyou need not be frightenedi never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the worldshe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingleyi think i have heard you say that you know themi know them a littletheir brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcysoh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of himcare of himyes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants carefrom something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to himbut i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meantit was all conjecturewhat is it you meanit is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thingyou may depend upon my not mentioning itand remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingleywhat he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summerdid mr darcy give you reasons for this interferencei understood that there were some very strong objections against the ladyand what arts did he use to separate themhe did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smilinghe only told me what i have now told youelizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignationafter watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtfuli am thinking of what you have been telling me said sheyour cousins conduct does not suit my feelingswhy was he to be the judgeyou are rather disposed to call his interference officiousi do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happybut she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the casethat is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadlythis was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonagethere shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heardit was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connectedthere could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influencethat he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of themif his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to sufferhe had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflictedthere were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in londonto jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she isher understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivatingneither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reachwhen she thought of her mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sisterthe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink teamrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at homechapter when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kentthey contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present sufferingbut in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever cloudedelizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusalmr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferingsit was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could doshe could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about himwhile settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after herbut this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the roomin an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were bettershe answered him with cold civilityhe sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the roomelizabeth was surprised but said not a wordafter a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus beganin vain i have struggledit will not domy feelings will not be repressedyou must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love youelizabeths astonishment was beyond expressionshe stared coloured doubted and was silentthis he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followedhe spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pridehis sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suitin spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in angershe tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have donehe concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his handas he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real securitysuch a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she saidin such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returnedit is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank youbut i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillinglyi am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyoneit has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short durationthe feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanationmr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprisehis complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every featurehe was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained itthe pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadfulat length with a voice of forced calmness he saidand this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expectingi might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejectedbut it is of small importancei might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your characterwas not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivilbut i have other provocationsyou know i havehad not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sisteras she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continuedi have every reason in the world to think ill of youno motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted thereyou dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kindshe paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorsehe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulitycan you deny that you have done it she repeatedwith assumed tranquillity he then repliedi have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my successtowards him i have been kinder than towards myselfelizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate herbut it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is foundedlong before it had taken place my opinion of you was decidedyour character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickhamon this subject what can you have to sayin what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon othersyou take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colourwho that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in himhis misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeedand of your infliction cried elizabeth with energyyou have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative povertyyou have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for himyou have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desertyou have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridiculeand this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of methis is the estimation in which you hold mei thank you for explaining it so fullymy faults according to this calculation are heavy indeedbut perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious designthese bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everythingbut disguise of every sort is my abhorrencenor am i ashamed of the feelings i relatedthey were natural and justcould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my ownelizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she saidyou are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike mannershe saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continuedyou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept itagain his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went onfrom the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayof my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marryyou have said quite enough madami perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have beenforgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happinessand with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the housethe tumult of her mind was now painfully greatshe knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhourher astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of itthat she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcythat he should have been in love with her for so many monthsso much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost incredibleit was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affectionbut his pride his abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excitedshe continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her roomchapter elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyesshe could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exerciseshe was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroadthe park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the groundafter walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the parkthe five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early treesshe was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreatingbut the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her nameshe had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gatehe had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composurei have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting youwill you do me the honour of reading that letterand then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sightwith no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise fullpursuing her way along the lane she then began itit was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as followsbe not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to youi write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and readyou must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justicetwo offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my chargethe first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blas*ed the prospects of mr wickhamwilfully an* wantonly to have thro*n off the compa*ion of my youth the ack*owledged favourite of my father a young man wh* had scarcely any other dependence than on our pat*onage and who had been brought up to expect i*s exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young p*rsons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks cou*d bear no comparison*ut from the severity of th*t blame which was last night so liberally bes*owed respecting each circumst*nce i shall hope to be in the future secured when the followi*g account of my actions and th*ir motives *as been readif *n the explanation of them*which is du* to myself i am under t*e necessity of relating feelings which may be offe*sive to yours*i can only say that i*am sorrythe neces*ity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurdi had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common wi*h others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the dance*at netherfie*d that i had any appre*ension of his feel*ng a serious att*chmenti had often see* him in love beforeat tha* ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted b* sir willia* lucass

that*evening my opinion of all partie* was confirmed and e*ery inducement height*ned which could ha*e led me before to preserve my frien* from what i*esteemed a*most unhappy connectionhe left

of art s* far as to conceal from him your sisters being in towni knew it myself as i* was known to miss bin*ley but her brother is even yet ignorant of itthat they might have met without ill

wickham is the *on of a very respectable *an who had fo* many years t*e management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the d*scharge of hi* trust naturally inclined my father to be

for a fortnight and was certain of a w*lling listener in jane whenever she might wish to ta*k again of eitherbut there was s*ill someth*ng lurking behind of which*prudence forbade the disclos*reshe

shal* merely be a*le to tell what bingley may tell in a much more *greeable mann*r himselfthe liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its valueshe was now*on being settled at home

the warmth of first *ttachment and from *er age and disposition greater ste*diness than most first attachments often boa*t and so fervently did she value his *emembrance and prefer him to every o*her

t*anquillitywell lizzy said mrs bennet one day*what is your opinion now of this sad business of janesfor*my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybodyi told *y sister phillips so the

to seek the other less interesting mode o* attachmentbe tha* as it may*she saw him go with regret and in this early exa*ple of what lydias inf*my must produce found additional *nguish as she reflec*ed

whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia*could ever have attached him had appeared in*omprehensiblebut now it was all too nat*ralfor such an attachment as this she might *ave

underst*nding would preserve her from falling an easy preyshe had never perceived while the regiment was*in hertfordshire that lydia had any parti*lity for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herse*f to anybody*ometimes one officer sometimes *nother had been her favourite as their attentions rais*d them in her o*inionher affections had continually been

seated in the carr*age and on the road to longbournchapter i have been thinking it *ver again elizabeth said her uncle as they drov* from the to*n and really upon ser*ous consideration i am much more inclined than i was to *udge as your eldest *ister does on the matterit appears to m* so very unlikely*that any young man should form *uch a design against * girl who is by no me*ns unprotected or *riendless an* who was actually staying in his colonels*family that i am strongly inclined to hope the bestcould he*expect that her friends would not step*forwardcould h* expect to b* noticed again by the regiment after such *n affront t* colonel fors*erhis temptation is not adequate to the riskdo you really think*so cried elizabet* brightening up*for a mome*tupon my word said mrs gar*iner i begin to be of your uncles opinionit is really *oo great a violation o* decency honour and inter*st for him to *e guilty ofi cannot think so very ill of wickhamcan you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of itnot perhaps of negle*ting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capableif indeed*it should be sobut*i dare not hope itw*y should they not go on to scotland if that had bee* the casein the first place replied mr *ardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotlandoh but their removing fro* the chaise into a hackn*y coach is such a presumptionan* besides no trac*s of them were to be found on the bar*et roadwell thensupposing them to be in londonth*y may be there though for the purpose *f concealment for no more exceptional pu*poseit is not li*ely that money should be*very abundant *n either side and it might str*ke them that th*y could be*more economically though less expeditiously married in londo* than in scotlandbut why all t*is secrecy*hy any fear of detecti*nwhy must their *arriage be privateoh no nothis is not likelyhis most particular friend you see by janes ac*ount was persuaded of his never intending to mar*y herwickham will never marry a wo*an without some moneyhe cann*t afford itan* what claims *as lydiawhat attraction has she beyond you*h health and good *umour that could make *im for her sake forego every chance of benefiting hi*self by marrying wellas to what restraint the apprehensi*ns of disgrace in the corps mi*ht throw on a dishonourable elopement w*th her i a* not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might producebut as to your other objection i am afraid it will*hardly hold goodlydia has *o brothers*to step forwa*d and he might im*gine from my fath*rs behaviour from his indolen*e and the little a*tention he has ever seemed to give to what *as going forwar* in his family that he wo*ld do as li*tle and thi*k as little about it as any f*ther could do in such a m*tterbut can you think tha* lydia is so lost to everything but love of h*m as to consent to live with him on *ny terms other than marriageit does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes t*at a sisters sense of dec*ncy and virt*e in such a point should admit of *oubtbut really*i know not what*to sayperhaps i am not doing her justicebu* she is very young she *as never been taught to think on serious subjects and for *he last halfyear nay for a twelvemonthsh* has been given up to nothing but amusement and v*nityshe has been

knows as well as i *o what wickham r*ally iswe both know that he has b*en profligate in every sense o* the word th*t he has neither integrity nor honour that he*is as false and deceitful as he i* insinuating*nd do you *eally know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of *er intelligence w*s all alivei do indeed*replied elizabeth colouri*gi told you the other day of his

*yselfand when * returned *ome the shire was to leave mer*ton in a week or fortnights timeas that wa* the case neither jane to whom*i related the whole nor i t*ought it necessar* to make our knowledge

how kind you arei*know you will contrive it allbut mr gardiner though he as*ured her again of h*s earnest en*eavours in the cause*could not avoid recommending moderation to her a* well in her hopes as her fea* and after talking *ith her in this manner till dinner was on the*table they all left her to *ent all her feelings*on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her da*ghtersthough her brother and s*ster were persuaded tha* there was no real occasion for such*a seclusion from t*e family they did not att*mpt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough *o hold her tongu* before the servants while the* waited at table and judged i* better that o*e only of th* household and the one wh*m they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subjectin the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too bu*ily engaged in their separate apa*tments to make their appearance beforeon* came from h*r books and the other from h*r toilettethe faces of both h*wever were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite s*ster or the anger which she ha* herself incurred in this business h*d given more of fretfuln*ss than usual to the accents of kittyas for mary she was m*stress enough of herself to w*isper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection s*on after they were seate* at tablethis *s a most unfortunate affair and w*ll probably be much talked ofbut *e must stem the t*de of malice and *our into the wo*nded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolationthen perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she addedunhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this *seful lesson*that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves*her in endless ruin t*at her reputation is no less brittle *han it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in *er behavio*r towards the undeserving o* the other *exelizabeth *ifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much*oppressed to *ake any replymary*however continued to console hers*lf with such kind of moral extractions from the

was equ*lly eager to sat*sfyafter joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly

ti*e for the co*solation of your*elf and mrs*bennet i am inclined to think th*t her own disposition *ust be naturally bad or she could not be guilty*of such an enormity at so early an agehowsoever that *ay be you *re grievously to be pitied in which*opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise*by lady catherine *nd her daughter to whom i have related the affairthey agree with me in

far as it would gob*t he found lydia absolutely resolved on remai*ing where she wasshe cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of *is she would not h*ar of leaving wickhams*e was sure they should be married some time or ot*er and it did *ot much signify whensince such were her feelings it only rem*ined he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in*his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt*had never been*his design he confessed *imself obliged to lea*e the regiment on account o* some debts of honour whi*h were very pressing and scrupled not to l*y all the il*consequences of lydias flight on her own fol*y alonehe m*ant to resign h*s commission *mmediately and as to his future situation he could co*jecture very little about ithe must*go somewhere but h* did not know where and he knew he should have noth*ng to live *nmr darcy asked him why he had not married your s*ster at oncethough m* bennet was not imagined to be very rich he*would have been able to do something*for him and his si*uation must have been benefited by marriagebut he found in reply to this ques*ion that wickham still ch*rished the *ope of more effectually making*his fortune by marriage in some oth*r countryunder such*circumstances however he was not l*kely to be *roof again*t the temptation*of immediate*reliefthey met several times for there was much to be discussedwickha* of course wanted more than *e could get but at length was re*uced to be reasonableevery thing*being settled between *hem mr darcys next step *as to make your uncl* acquainted with it and he first called in*gracechurch stree* the evening before i came homebut mr*gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy f*und on further inquiry that your fath*r was still with h*m but would quit t*wn the next morninghe did not judge your father to be a per*on whom he could so *roperly cons*lt as your uncle and therefore r*adily postponed seeing hi* till after the departure of the for*erhe did n*t leave his name and*till the next da* it was only known that a gentleman had called on businesson sa*urday he came againyour father w*s gone your uncle at*home and as i sa*d before they had a great deal of talk togetherthey met a*ain on sunday and then i saw him tooit was not all se*tled before monda* as soon as it was the express*was sent off to lon*bournbut our visitor was very obstinatei fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real *efect of his character after allhe has been accused of many faults at*different times but this is the true onenothin* was to be done *hat he did not do himself*though i am sure and*i do not sp*ak it to be thanked therefore say no*hing about ity*ur uncle would most r*adily have settled the whole*hey battled it together for a long time which was more th*n either the gentleman or lady concerned in i* deservedbut at last your uncl* was forced to yield and instead of being *llowed to be of use to *is niece was fo*ced to put up with only having *he probable credit of i* which went sorely against t*e grain and i really be*ieve your letter this mor*ing gave him great pleasure because it required *n explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feat*ers and give the pr*ise where it was duebut lizzy this must go no farther than yoursel* or jane at mostyou know pretty well i suppose what h*s been done for the young peopleh*s debts are to b* paid amounting i*believe to considerably more than a thousa*d pounds another tho*sand in additi*n to her own settle* upon her and his commission purchasedthe reas*n why all this was to *e done by him a*one was such as i have given aboveit was owing to him to his reserve and want of*proper consideration that wickham* character had been so misunderstood and consequently tha* he had been *eceived and noticed as he wasperhaps there was some tr*th in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be a*swerable for t*e eventbut in s*ite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perf*ctly assured that you* uncle would never*have yielded if we had not given him cre*it for ano*her interest in the affairwhen all t*is was resolved on he r*turned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it*was agreed that *e should be in london once m*re when the wedding took place a*d all money matters w*re then to receive the last f*nishi believe i hav* now told you every thingit is a

trouble of this journey from ro*ings for the sole purpose of breaking off her *upposed engagement with*mr darcyit was a rational sc*eme to be sure but *rom what the report of their engagement could*originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected *hat his bein* the intimate friend of bingley and h*r being the si*ter of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the ideashe had not*herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her*sister must bring the* more frequently togethe*and her neighbours at lucas

i*terferencefrom what she had s*id of her res*lution to prevent t*eir marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must medit*te an application to *er nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attache* to a connection with her she dared *ot pronounceshe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judg*ent but it*was natural to su*pose that he thought much h*gher of her la*yship than s*e could do and *t was certain tha* in enumer*ting the miseri*s of a marriage wi*h one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his w*akest sidewith his notions of dignity he *ould probably*feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had app*ared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoningif he had been wa*ering before *s to what he shoul* do which had often*seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determ*ne him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make himin that case he would return no m*relady catherine mi*ht see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give wayif therefore an excuse for not keeping his pr*mise should come to his friend within a few day* she added i shall know how to unders*and iti shall then give over eve*y expectati*n every wish *f his constancyif he is sa*isfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained*my affections and hand i shall*soon cease to regret him at allthe surprise*of the rest of the family o* hearing who the*r visitor had been was *ery great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which*had appeased mrs *ennets curiosity and eliza*eth was spared from much teasin* on the subjectthe next morning as she was going dow*stairs she *as met by her father who came out*of his library with a letter in his handlizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my roomshe fo*lowed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heigh*ened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the l*tter he heldit *uddenly struck her that it might be from lady*catherine and she anticipated wi*h dismay all the co*sequent expl*nationsshe followed her father *o the fire*place and they both sat down he then saidi have received a letter this

what deligh*ed pride she afterwards vi*ited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy *ay be guessedi w*sh i could*say for the sake of her*family that the accom*lishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so hap*y an effect as to make h*r a sensible am*able wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps i* was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably sillymr bennet*missed his second daughte* exceedingly his af*ection for her drew him oftener from home th*n anything else cou*d dohe delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expectedmr bingley and *ane remained*at netherfield only a *welvemonthso near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relati*ns was not desirable even to his easy t*mper or her affecti*nate heartthe darling wish of his sister* was then gratifie* he bought an estate in a neighbouring co*nty to

became by proper atte*tion and management less irrita*le less ign*rant and less insipidfrom the further disadvantage of lydias society she*was of course carefully k*pt and though mrs wickham frequently invited he* to come an* stay with her with the pr*mise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her goingmary*was the only daughter who remained at h*me and she was necessarily drawn from the *ursuit of accompli*hments by mrs bennets b*ing quite unable to sit alo*emary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could sti*l moralize over every morning visit

their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her *istershe bor* with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth mu*t now become ac*uainted with whatever of his ingr*titude and falsehood had before been *nknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy mig*t yet be prevailed on to make his fortunethe congratulatory letter which elizabeth received*from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherishedthe letter was t* this effectmy dear lizzy*i wish you joyif you*love mr darcy *alf as well

her po*er to afford by the practi*e of what might be called economy in her own private expences s*e frequently sent themit had always been evident to her that such an in*ome as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insuf*icient to their*support and whenever th*y changed their quarte*s either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assis*ance towards discharging their billstheir manner*of living even when*the restoration of pe*ce dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extremethey were always movi*g from place to *lace in quest of a che*p situation and alway* spending more th*n they oughthis affection for h*r soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her man*ers she ret*ined all the claims t* reputation which her mar*iage had given herthough darcy could never receive him *t pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted hi* further in

part of his aunt h*r resentment gave way either to her*affection f*r him or her*curiosity to s*e how his wife conduc*ed herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that
